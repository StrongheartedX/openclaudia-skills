# Contributing to OpenClaudia

Thanks for your interest in contributing! OpenClaudia is an open-source marketing toolkit for AI coding agents, and we welcome contributions of all kinds.

## Ways to Contribute

- **New skills** — add a marketing skill that solves a real problem
- **Bug fixes** — fix issues in existing skills
- **Documentation** — improve README, skill descriptions, or examples
- **API integrations** — connect skills to new marketing APIs
- **Translations** — help make skills work in more languages

## Creating a New Skill

### 1. Pick a skill idea

Check [open issues](https://github.com/OpenClaudia/openclaudia-skills/issues) for requested skills, or propose your own. If you're unsure whether your idea fits, open an issue to discuss first.

### 2. Create the skill directory

```
skills/
  your-skill-name/
    SKILL.md          # Required — the skill definition
```

Skill names should be lowercase, hyphenated, and descriptive: `seo-audit`, `write-blog`, `email-sequence`.

### 3. Write the SKILL.md

Every skill is a single `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and detailed instructions:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: One-line description of what this skill does (shown in skill list)
---

# Your Skill Name

Detailed instructions that the AI agent will follow when this skill is invoked.

## When to use this skill

Describe the trigger phrases and use cases.

## What this skill does

Step-by-step instructions for the agent:
1. Gather input from the user
2. Call APIs or read files
3. Generate output
4. Write results to disk or take action

## API Requirements (if any)

List any API keys needed and how to configure them.
```

### 4. Skill authoring guidelines

- **Be specific** — the more precise your instructions, the better the agent performs
- **Include examples** — show the agent what good output looks like
- **Handle errors** — tell the agent what to do when an API key is missing or a request fails
- **Keep it focused** — one skill should do one thing well
- **Test it** — run your skill in Claude Code before submitting

### 5. Submit a pull request

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b skill/your-skill-name`
3. Add your skill directory under `skills/`
4. Update the README if your skill adds a new category
5. Open a PR with:
   - What the skill does
   - How you tested it
   - Any API keys required

## Code Review Standards

We review PRs for:

- **Correctness** — does the skill do what it claims?
- **Clarity** — are the instructions clear and unambiguous?
- **Safety** — does the skill avoid destructive actions without user confirmation?
- **Privacy** — does the skill avoid sending user data to unexpected third parties?
