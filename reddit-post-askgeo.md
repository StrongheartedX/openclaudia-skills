# We built an open-source GEO toolkit that runs entirely in your terminal

GEO is still early, and most of us are figuring it out as we go. One thing that's clear: the fundamentals still matter — structured data, E-E-A-T signals, clean content, strong SEO foundations. AI models pull from the same web that search engines crawl.

We built **OpenClaudia** — 34 open-source marketing skills that run inside coding agents like Claude Code and Codex. A few of them are directly relevant to GEO:

**Skills that help with GEO:**

- `/seo-audit` — crawls your site against 230+ rules, catches technical issues that hurt both traditional search and AI visibility
- `/schema-markup` — generates and validates Schema.org structured data (the kind that helps AI models understand your content)
- `/write-blog` — creates content following E-E-A-T principles with proper heading hierarchy, meta tags, and keyword placement
- `/keyword-research` — pulls real data from SemRush, DataForSEO, and SerpAPI to find what people (and AI models) are searching for
- `/serp-analyzer` — analyzes what currently ranks and identifies featured snippets, People Also Ask, knowledge panels — the same features AI models reference
- `/competitor-analysis` — full breakdown of how competitors structure their content and authority signals

**Why this matters for GEO:**

AI-generated answers pull from authoritative, well-structured sources. If your site has clean schema markup, strong topical authority, proper citations, and content that directly answers questions — you're more likely to be cited by AI models. These skills help you get there systematically.

**Install:**

```
npx openclaudia install --all
```

Everything is open source, runs locally, and your data stays on your machine.
