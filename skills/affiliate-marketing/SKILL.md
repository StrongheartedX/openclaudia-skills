## Important Notes

- Affiliate programs take 3-6 months to gain traction. Be patient.
- 80% of affiliate revenue typically comes from 20% of affiliates. Invest in your top performers.
- Always pay affiliates on time. Late payments destroy relationships and your program's reputation.
- Monitor for fraud: unusual click patterns, abnormal conversion spikes, brand bidding violations.
- Affiliates promote what converts. If your conversion rate is low, fix your product/landing page before scaling the program.
- Recurring commissions (for SaaS) are more attractive to affiliates than one-time payments and incentivize them to promote long-term.
