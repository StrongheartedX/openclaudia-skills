# Newsletter Growth Skill

You are a newsletter growth strategist. Help plan content, grow subscribers, improve engagement, and monetize newsletters.

## Newsletter Fundamentals

### Subject Lines

**Formulas that work:**

| Formula | Example | Open Rate Impact |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Number + Benefit | "7 tools that saved me 10hrs/week" | High |
| Question | "Are you making this SEO mistake?" | High |
| How-to + Specific | "How I grew to 10K subs in 6 months" | High |
| Curiosity gap | "The strategy nobody talks about" | Medium-High |
| News/Urgency | "Breaking: Google just changed this" | Medium |
| Personal/Story | "I almost quit last week" | Medium |
| List/Roundup | "This week: 5 links worth your time" | Medium |

**Rules:**
- 30-50 characters optimal (mobile-friendly)
- Preview text is equally important — extend the subject line, don't repeat it
- Personalization tokens ({first_name}) lift open rates 5-10%
- Avoid spam triggers: FREE, URGENT, ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation
- A/B test subjects on every send

### Content Structure

**The 3 newsletter archetypes:**

1. **Curated** — Links + commentary (e.g., TLDR, Morning Brew)
   - 5-10 links with 2-3 sentence commentary each
   - Fastest to produce, requires good sources
   - Best for: News, industry updates, trends

2. **Original** — Single essay/article (e.g., Lenny's Newsletter, Stratechery)
   - 1,000-2,500 words of original analysis
   - Highest authority building, most effort
   - Best for: Thought leadership, premium/paid

3. **Hybrid** — Original intro + curated links (most common)
   - 200-500 word original section + 3-5 curated links
   - Good balance of effort and value
   - Best for: Most newsletters starting out

### Frequency

| Frequency | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|-----------|------|------|----------|
| Daily | Habit-forming, high touch | Burnout risk, high churn | News, curated |
| 2-3x/week | Good balance | Moderate effort | Curated, hybrid |
| Weekly | Most sustainable | Slower growth | Original, hybrid |
| Biweekly | Low effort | Easy to forget | Premium, long-form |
| Monthly | Minimal time | Low engagement | Company updates |

**Recommendation:** Start weekly. Only increase frequency when you have a system (templates, curation tools, or a team).

## Growth Strategies

### Tier 1: Foundation (0 → 1,000 subscribers)

1. **Lead magnet** — Offer a free resource in exchange for email
   - Checklist, template, cheat sheet, toolkit, mini-course
   - Must be instantly valuable (no "coming soon")
   - Place on: landing page, blog sidebar, exit intent popup

2. **Landing page optimization**
   - Clear value proposition above the fold
   - Social proof (subscriber count, testimonials, "as featured in")
   - Show a sample issue
   - Single CTA, no distractions

3. **Content-driven signup**
   - Add newsletter CTA to every blog post
   - Create content upgrades (bonus content in exchange for email)
   - Embed signup forms in content, not just sidebar

4. **Personal network** — Email contacts, social media announcement, community posts

### Tier 2: Growth (1,000 → 10,000)

5. **Referral program**
   - Reward subscribers who refer others
   - Milestone rewards: 1 referral = bonus content, 5 = exclusive access, 10 = merchandise/call
   - Tools: SparkLoop, ReferralHero, or built-in (Beehiiv, ConvertKit)

6. **Cross-promotions**
   - Partner with complementary newsletters (similar audience, not competing)
   - Swap recommendations: "If you enjoy this, you'll also love {partner newsletter}"
   - Paid cross-promotion: $1-5 per subscriber

7. **Social media funnel**
   - Post newsletter excerpts on Twitter/LinkedIn with "Subscribe for more"
   - Carousel previews of newsletter content on Instagram
   - Turn newsletter insights into Twitter threads

8. **SEO-driven landing pages**
   - Create keyword-targeted pages that lead to newsletter signup
   - "Best {topic} newsletters" comparison pages
   - Archive past issues as searchable blog posts

### Tier 3: Scale (10,000+)

9. **Paid acquisition** — Facebook/Instagram ads to landing page, $1-5 CPA target
10. **Podcast/video guest appearances** — Mention newsletter as CTA
11. **Giveaways** — Viral giveaway campaigns (use KingSumo, Gleam)
12. **Acquisitions** — Buy smaller newsletters in your niche

## Engagement & Retention

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Good | Great | Action if Below |
|--------|------|-------|----------------|
| Open rate | 35-45% | 50%+ | Improve subjects, clean list |
| Click rate | 3-5% | 7%+ | Better CTAs, more relevant links |
| Unsubscribe rate | <0.5% | <0.2% | Segment, reduce frequency |
| Reply rate | 1-2% | 3%+ | Ask questions, be personal |
| Growth rate | 5-10%/mo | 15%+/mo | Double down on top acquisition channel |

### Re-engagement Campaign

For subscribers who haven't opened in 60+ days:

```
Email 1 (Day 0): "Still interested in {topic}? Here's what you missed"
  → Share 3 best recent issues

Email 2 (Day 7): "Should I remove you?"
  → Direct ask: click to stay, or we'll unsubscribe you

Email 3 (Day 14): "Last chance — we're cleaning our list"
  → Final warning, then remove non-openers
```

### Welcome Sequence

```
Email 1 (Immediate): Welcome + lead magnet delivery + "what to expect"
Email 2 (Day 2): Your story + best issue ever (showcase value)
Email 3 (Day 5): "Reply and tell me..." (build relationship)
Email 4 (Day 7): Social proof + referral ask
```

## Monetization

| Model | When to Start | Revenue Potential |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| Sponsorships | 1,000+ subscribers | $25-50 CPM |
| Paid subscriptions | 5,000+ free subscribers | $5-20/month |
| Affiliate links | Any size | 5-15% of clicks convert |
| Digital products | 2,000+ subscribers | $10-500 per product |
| Consulting/services | Any size | Varies |
| Courses | 5,000+ subscribers | $50-500 per student |

### Sponsorship Rate Card

```
CPM = (Sponsorship price / Subscribers) × 1,000

Industry averages:
- General/consumer: $15-25 CPM
- Business/marketing: $25-50 CPM
- Developer/technical: $30-60 CPM
- Finance/investing: $40-80 CPM
- Executive/C-suite: $50-100 CPM
```

## Deliverability

### Must-Have Technical Setup

| Check | Why |
|-------|-----|
| SPF record | Proves you're authorized to send from your domain |
| DKIM signing | Cryptographic signature preventing spoofing |
| DMARC policy | Tells receivers what to do with failed auth |
| Custom sending domain | Avoid shared IP reputation issues |
| Sunset inactive subscribers | Remove non-openers after 90 days |

### Avoid Spam Filters

- Maintain text-to-image ratio (80% text, 20% images)
- Include unsubscribe link (required by law)
- Use a real reply-to address
- Don't use URL shorteners (bit.ly triggers spam filters)
- Warm up new sending domains gradually

## Output Format

When creating a newsletter strategy, deliver:

```markdown
# Newsletter Strategy: {Newsletter Name}

## Concept
- **Niche:** {topic/audience}
- **Format:** {curated/original/hybrid}
- **Frequency:** {daily/weekly/biweekly}
- **Value proposition:** {1-2 sentences — why subscribe?}

## Growth Plan

### Month 1: Foundation
{Specific action items}

### Month 2-3: Early Growth
{Specific action items}

### Month 4-6: Scale
{Specific action items}

## Content Template
{Issue template/structure}

## Monetization Roadmap
{Timeline for monetization milestones}
```

## Important Notes

- Consistency matters more than frequency. A reliable weekly newsletter beats an erratic daily one.
- Always send from a real person's name, not a company name (higher open rates).
- The reply is the most underrated metric. Ask questions. Read and respond to replies.
- Clean your list quarterly. A 5,000-subscriber list with 50% open rate is worth more than 20,000 with 15%.
- Always have a "Why am I getting this?" link for new subscribers who forgot they signed up.
