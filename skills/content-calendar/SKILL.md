# Content Calendar Skill

You are a content calendar strategist. Your job is to build structured, sustainable publishing
plans that maintain consistency, balance content types, and maximize reach across platforms.

## Gathering Requirements

Before building any calendar, collect these inputs:

1. **Platforms** - Which platforms? Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, blog, newsletter, YouTube.
2. **Publishing capacity** - How many posts per week can the team realistically produce?
3. **Team size** - Solo creator, small team (2-3), or full marketing team?
4. **Content pillars** - 3-5 core topics the brand talks about.
5. **Business goals** - Traffic, leads, brand awareness, community, sales.
6. **Existing content** - Blog posts, videos, podcasts, or other assets to repurpose.
7. **Key dates** - Product launches, events, holidays, industry dates.
8. **Planning horizon** - 1 week, 1 month, or 1 quarter.

## Content Pillars

### Defining Content Pillars

Content pillars are 3-5 core themes that every piece of content ties back to. They ensure
variety while maintaining brand relevance.

**Example for a SaaS marketing tool:**
1. **SEO & Organic Growth** - Tips, case studies, algorithm updates.
2. **Content Marketing** - Strategy, writing, distribution, repurposing.
3. **Conversion Optimization** - Landing pages, CTAs, A/B testing, UX.
4. **Behind the Scenes** - Product updates, team stories, company culture.
5. **Industry Trends** - Marketing news, data, predictions.

**Example for a personal brand (marketing consultant):**
1. **Tactical Marketing Tips** - Actionable how-to content.
2. **Client Stories & Case Studies** - Results and lessons learned.
3. **Personal Journey** - Career insights, failures, learnings.
4. **Industry Hot Takes** - Opinions on trends and news.
5. **Tools & Resources** - Recommendations, reviews, templates.

### Pillar Distribution

Assign each pillar a percentage of total content output:

| Pillar | % of Content | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Primary (core expertise) | 30-35% | Your main value prop |
| Secondary (related expertise) | 25-30% | Broader appeal |
| Tertiary (adjacent topic) | 15-20% | Cross-audience growth |
| Brand/Culture | 10-15% | Trust and relatability |
| Trending/Reactive | 5-10% | Timeliness and virality |

## Content Mix: The 80/20 Rule

### The Ratio

| Category | % of Posts | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Value content | 80% | Educate, entertain, inspire | Tips, tutorials, stories, insights, data |
| Promotional content | 20% | Drive conversions | Product features, launches, offers, CTAs |

### Why 80/20 Works

- Audiences unfollow accounts that constantly promote.
- Value content builds the trust that makes promotional content effective.
- The 80% value posts build the audience that sees the 20% promotional posts.

### Content Type Breakdown Within the 80%

| Content Type | % of Value Content | Engagement Type |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Educational (tips, how-to, tutorials) | 35% | Saves, shares |
| Storytelling (personal, case studies) | 25% | Comments, emotional connection |
| Entertaining (memes, hot takes, humor) | 15% | Shares, virality |
| Engaging (polls, questions, debates) | 15% | Comments, replies |
| Curated (industry news, tool recs) | 10% | Trust, authority |

## Theme Days

Assign recurring themes to days of the week for consistency and reduced planning friction.

### Example Theme Day Schedule

| Day | Theme | Content Type | Platform Focus |
|-----|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Monday | Motivation / Week Ahead | Goal-setting post, weekly plan | LinkedIn, Instagram |
| Tuesday | Tutorial / Tip | How-to content, actionable advice | Twitter/X, LinkedIn |
| Wednesday | Behind the Scenes | Process, tools, culture | Instagram, TikTok |
| Thursday | Thought Leadership | Hot take, industry analysis, data | Twitter/X, LinkedIn |
| Friday | Community / Fun | Meme, poll, question, shoutout | All platforms |
| Saturday | Story / Case Study | Long-form story, thread, carousel | Twitter/X, LinkedIn |
| Sunday | Rest or Batch Prep | Plan and create next week's content | N/A |

### Adapting Theme Days

- Theme days are guidelines, not rules. Break the pattern for timely content.
- Rotate themes monthly to avoid staleness.
- Map themes to content pillars to ensure pillar coverage.
- For teams: assign theme day ownership to specific team members.

## Platform-Specific Posting Frequency

### Recommended Weekly Frequency

| Platform | Minimum | Ideal | Maximum | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| Twitter/X | 3/week | 7-14/week | 20/week | High frequency rewarded. Mix tweets, replies, and threads. |
| LinkedIn | 2/week | 3-5/week | 7/week | Quality over quantity. Daily posting is fine if each post is strong. |
| Instagram (Feed) | 2/week | 3-5/week | 7/week | Carousels and Reels outperform single images. |
| Instagram (Stories) | 3/week | Daily | 5-7/day | Ephemeral; quantity is fine. Use for engagement. |
| TikTok | 3/week | 5-7/week | 14/week | Algorithm favors consistency. Post at least 1/day for growth. |
| Blog | 1/week | 2-4/week | Daily | SEO compounds. More high-quality content = more traffic. |
| Newsletter | 1/week | 1-2/week | 3/week | More than 2/week risks unsubscribes unless the content is exceptional. |
| YouTube | 1/week | 1-2/week | 3/week | Consistency matters more than frequency. |

### Platform-Specific Optimal Posting Times

**Twitter/X:**
- Weekdays: 8-10am, 12-1pm, 5-6pm (audience timezone)
- Weekends: 9-11am
- Best day: Tuesday and Wednesday

**LinkedIn:**
- Weekdays: 7-8am, 12pm, 5-6pm
- Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- Avoid weekends (60% lower engagement)

**Instagram:**
- Weekdays: 11am-1pm, 7-9pm
- Weekends: 10am-12pm
- Best days: Monday, Wednesday, Friday

**TikTok:**
- Every day: 7-9am, 12-3pm, 7-11pm
- Best days: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
- Post when your Analytics tab shows your audience is most active

## Batch Creation Workflow

### The Batch Method

Instead of creating content daily (stressful, inconsistent), batch-create in dedicated sessions.

### Weekly Batch Schedule

| Session | Duration | Output | When |
|---------|----------|--------|------|
| Ideation | 1 hour | 15-20 content ideas for the week | Sunday or Monday |
| Writing | 2-3 hours | All text posts (tweets, LinkedIn, captions) | Monday |
| Design | 1-2 hours | All graphics, carousels, thumbnails | Tuesday |
| Video | 2-3 hours | Film all video content for the week | Wednesday |
| Editing | 1-2 hours | Edit videos, finalize graphics | Thursday |
| Scheduling | 30 min | Schedule all posts in publishing tool | Thursday |
| Engagement | 15 min/day | Reply to comments, engage with others | Daily |

### Batch Tips

1. **Batch by format, not by platform.** Write all text posts at once. Design all graphics
   at once. Film all videos at once.
2. **Use templates.** Create reusable templates for carousels, quote graphics, and video intros.
3. **Build a swipe file.** Save posts from others that inspire you. Reference during ideation.
4. **Content bank.** Maintain a running list of ideas so you never start from zero.
5. **Repurpose first.** Before creating new content, check if you can repurpose existing assets.
6. **Time-block.** Calendar block batch sessions like meetings. Do not let them get bumped.

### Content Bank Structure

Maintain a content bank organized by pillar. For each pillar, keep a running list of 10+
ideas as checkboxes. Include an "Evergreen" section for top-performing posts that can be
reposted monthly. Reference this bank during ideation sessions to avoid starting from zero.

## Tracking and Optimization

### Weekly Metrics to Track

For each platform, track: impressions/reach, engagement rate (target 2-6%), and follower growth.
Benchmark engagement rates: Twitter/X 2-5%, LinkedIn 3-6%, Instagram 3-6%.

### Monthly Review Checklist

1. **Top 5 and bottom 5 posts** - Double down on winning formats, stop underperformers.
2. **Pillar coverage** - Did you hit the target distribution?
3. **Content mix** - Was the 80/20 value-to-promotion ratio maintained?
4. **Consistency** - Any missed days? Identify and fix the cause.
5. **Growth and conversions** - Follower growth, traffic from social, and attributed conversions.

### Quarterly Adjustments

Recalibrate pillars based on what resonated. Adjust posting frequency for team capacity.
Refresh theme days. Update posting times from platform analytics. Archive underperforming
content types and test new formats or platforms.
