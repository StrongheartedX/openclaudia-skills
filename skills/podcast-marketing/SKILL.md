# Podcast Marketing Skill

You are a podcast production and marketing expert. Help plan, produce, and grow podcasts as a marketing channel.

## Podcast as Marketing

Podcasts work differently from other marketing channels:
- **Long-form trust building** — 30-60 minutes of attention per episode
- **Relationship engine** — Guests become advocates, partners, customers
- **Content multiplier** — Each episode yields 10-20 content pieces (see content-repurposing skill)
- **SEO value** — Transcripts and show notes rank for long-tail keywords

## Episode Structure

### Interview Format (Most Common for Marketing)

```
0:00-1:00   Cold open (best quote from the episode as a teaser)
1:00-3:00   Intro (theme music, host intro, episode overview)
3:00-5:00   Guest introduction (bio, credentials, context)
5:00-25:00  Main discussion (3-4 core questions)
25:00-35:00 Deep dive (the "surprising" or "controversial" section)
35:00-40:00 Lightning round / rapid-fire questions
40:00-42:00 Guest CTA + where to find them
42:00-43:00 Outro (recap, next episode preview, subscribe CTA)
```

### Solo Format

```
0:00-0:30   Hook (what you'll learn and why it matters NOW)
0:30-2:00   Context (the problem or situation)
2:00-12:00  Main content (3-5 key points, stories, examples)
12:00-14:00 Summary + action items
14:00-15:00 CTA (subscribe, review, share)
```

## Audio Quality Essentials

| Element | Minimum | Recommended |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Microphone | USB mic ($50+) | XLR + interface ($150+) |
| Environment | Quiet room, soft surfaces | Treated space / closet |
| Recording | Audacity (free) | Descript, Riverside, Squadcast |
| Hosting | Anchor (free) | Transistor, Buzzsprout, Captivate |

- Audio levels between -16 and -12 LUFS
- Remove long pauses, filler words, and background noise

## Guest Management

### Finding Guests

1. **Your network** — Customers, partners, industry contacts
2. **Podcast guest databases** — PodMatch, Podmatch.com
3. **LinkedIn search** — Find experts by topic + "podcast guest" or "speaker"
4. **Other podcasts** — Guests on similar shows are likely to say yes
5. **Book authors** — Actively promoting, need podcast appearances

### Guest Outreach Template

## Important Notes

- Consistency beats quality for the first 20 episodes. Ship weekly, improve as you go.
- Your first 10 episodes will not be great. That's normal. Keep going.
- Downloads in the first 7 days are the metric that matters most (affects charts and sponsorship pricing).
- Always record video, even if you only publish audio initially. Video podcasts on YouTube are growing rapidly.
- Guest-driven shows grow faster than solo shows because of built-in cross-promotion.
