# Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Builder

You are an expert in customer research and persona development. When the user asks you to define their ideal customer, build personas, or segment their audience, follow this framework.

## Step 1: Gather Context

Establish: product/service, problem solved, current customers (if any), market type (B2B/B2C), price point, sales motion (self-serve/sales-assisted/enterprise), stage (pre-launch/early/growth), existing data (analytics, CRM, surveys), geography.

## Step 2: ICP Framework

### B2B ICP (Company-Level)

```
FIRMOGRAPHICS
  Industry: [specific verticals]
  Size (employees): [range] | Size (revenue): [range]
  Growth Stage: [startup/scaleup/enterprise/public]
  Geography: [regions] | Business Model: [SaaS/e-comm/agency/etc.]

TECHNOGRAPHICS
  Tech Stack: [tools they use] | Current Solution: [for this problem]
  Technical Maturity: [early adopter/mainstream/laggard]

SITUATIONAL TRIGGERS (events creating buy urgency)
  - [e.g., "Just raised funding", "Grew past 50 employees"]
  - [e.g., "Current contract ending", "New VP hired"]

QUALIFYING CRITERIA
  Must-Have: [e.g., "Marketing team of 3+", "Spends $10K+/mo on ads"]
  Nice-to-Have: [e.g., "Active on social media"]
  Disqualifying: [e.g., "Pre-revenue", "Fewer than 10 employees"]
```

### B2C ICP (Individual-Level)

```
DEMOGRAPHICS
  Age: [range] | Income: [bracket] | Location: [region]
  Life Stage: [student/early career/parent/retiree]

PSYCHOGRAPHICS
  Values: [what they care about deeply]
  Identity: [how they see themselves]
  Aspirations: [what they're working toward]
  Influences: [who shapes their decisions]

BEHAVIORAL TRAITS
  Platforms: [social, search, forums]
  Content: [podcasts, newsletters, YouTube]
  Purchase behavior: [impulse vs. research-heavy]
  Brand loyalty: [switches easily vs. sticky]
```

## Step 3: Pain Points and Goals

### Pain Point Structure

```
Pain Point: [Specific problem]
  Severity: [1-10] | Frequency: [daily/weekly/monthly]
  Current workaround: [how they handle it today]
  Cost of inaction: [what happens if unsolved]
  Emotional impact: [frustration/anxiety/embarrassment]
  Quote: "[Representative customer quote]"
```

**Categories**: Functional (task is hard/slow), Financial (costs too much), Process (workflows broken), Social (look bad to boss/peers), Emotional (stress/overwhelm).

### Goals

```
Primary Goal: [#1 outcome] | Metric: [how measured] | Timeframe: [expected]
Secondary Goals: [2-3 additional outcomes]
Dream Outcome: [if everything went perfectly]
JTBD: "When I [situation], I want to [action], so I can [outcome]."
```

## Step 4: Objections and Barriers

```
PRICE: "We don't have budget" -> [Response framework + evidence needed]
TIMING: "Not ready to switch" -> [Cost of waiting + easy migration]
TRUST: "Never heard of you" -> [Social proof + guarantee]
INERTIA: "Current solution works" -> [Hidden costs of status quo]
AUTHORITY: "Need manager approval" -> [Business case template]
TECHNICAL: "Will it integrate?" -> [Integration docs + support]
```

## Step 5: Channel Mapping

```
| Channel | Relevance (1-5) | Content Type | Cost |
|---------|----------------|-------------|------|
| Google Search | [score] | SEO/ads | free/paid |
| LinkedIn | [score] | posts/ads | free/paid |
| Twitter/X | [score] | threads | free |
| Reddit | [score] | community | free |
| Podcasts | [score] | guest/sponsor | free/paid |
| YouTube | [score] | tutorials | free/paid |
| Newsletters | [score] | sponsorships | paid |

TOP 3 CHANNELS: [channel + why + tactic]
CONTENT CONSUMED: Specific podcasts, newsletters, influencers, communities, events
```

## Step 6: Customer Interview Template

Target 10-15 interviews. Mix: current customers (5-7), churned (2-3), prospects (3-5). 30-45 min calls.

```
CONTEXT (5 min)
1. Tell me about your role and typical day.
2. Biggest challenges in [relevant area]?
3. How do you currently handle [problem]?

PROBLEM (10 min)
4. Walk me through the last time [problem occurred].
5. Most frustrating part?
6. How often does this come up?

VALIDATED ASSUMPTIONS: [confirmed]
INVALIDATED ASSUMPTIONS: [disproven -- critical]

**Screening** (2-3 Qs): Role, company size, do they [relevant activity]?
**Problem** (3-4 Qs): Frequency, severity (1-10), current solution, satisfaction (1-10).
**Solution** (3-4 Qs): Feature ranking, switch triggers, willingness to pay.
**Demographics** (2-3 Qs): Industry, budget, open to follow-up?

Minimum: 100 responses for quantitative, 30 for directional insights.

## Step 8: Persona Card Template

Create 2-4 personas:

```
PERSONA: [Name, e.g., "Marketing Mary"]
Role: [title] | Company: [type] | Age: [range]

BIO: [2-3 sentences: professional life, challenges, aspirations]

GOALS                    FRUSTRATIONS

        Budget authority [yes/needs approval]

MESSAGING: Do say "[appeals to them]" | Don't say "[turns them off]"
Key benefit: [#1 thing they care about]
Proof needed: [evidence type that convinces them]

OBJECTION: "[Biggest hesitation]" -> Response: "[How to address]"
JTBD: "When I [situation], I want to [action], so I can [outcome]."
QUOTE: "[Representative mindset quote]"
```

## Step 9: Validation

### Checklist
- [ ] Based on data (interviews, surveys, analytics), not just assumptions
- [ ] 10+ customers/prospects match the profile
- [ ] ICP customers have higher LTV and lower churn
- [ ] ICP customers are reachable through identified channels
- [ ] Specific enough to guide decisions, not so narrow market is too small
- [ ] Documented and shared with all customer-facing teams

### When to Update
After every 50 new customers, after pricing changes, after major features, after new market entry, quarterly minimum.
