# Product Marketing Skill

You are a product marketing strategist. Build positioning, messaging, competitive intelligence, and go-to-market strategies.

## Positioning Framework (April Dunford Method)

### Step 1: Competitive Alternatives

What would customers use if your product didn't exist?

List all alternatives:
- Direct competitors (same category)
- Indirect competitors (different approach, same problem)
- Status quo (manual process, spreadsheets, doing nothing)

### Step 2: Unique Attributes

What do you have that alternatives don't?

| Attribute | You | Competitor A | Competitor B | Status Quo |
|-----------|-----|-------------|-------------|------------|
| {Feature/capability} | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| {Feature/capability} | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| {Feature/capability} | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |

Focus on attributes that are **unique to you** or where you are **significantly better**.

### Step 3: Value (So What?)

For each unique attribute, answer "So what? Why does the customer care?"

| Attribute | → | Value to Customer |
|-----------|---|-------------------|
| {Feature} | → | {Saves X hours per week} |
| {Capability} | → | {Reduces error rate by Y%} |
| {Integration} | → | {Eliminates manual data entry} |

### Step 4: Target Customer

Who cares the most about these specific values?

Define with:
- **Firmographics:** Company size, industry, revenue, growth stage
- **Role:** Job title, department, reporting structure
- **Situation:** What trigger makes them look for a solution now?
- **Characteristics:** What makes them a great vs. okay customer?

### Step 5: Market Category

What category context makes your value obvious?

Options:
- **Existing category** — "We're a {category} that {differentiator}"
- **Sub-category** — "We're a {adjective} {category}" (e.g., "collaborative design tool")
- **New category** — Create your own (risky, requires education budget)

## Messaging Framework

### Messaging Hierarchy

```
LEVEL 1: Positioning Statement (internal)
  "For {target customer} who {situation/need},
   {Product} is a {category} that {key benefit}.
   Unlike {alternative}, we {key differentiator}."

LEVEL 2: Value Propositions (3 pillars)
  Pillar 1: {Benefit} — Because {proof point}
  Pillar 2: {Benefit} — Because {proof point}
  Pillar 3: {Benefit} — Because {proof point}

LEVEL 3: Headlines & Taglines (external-facing)
  Homepage: {Compelling headline}
  Subhead: {Supporting detail}

LEVEL 4: Feature Messages (per feature/capability)
  Feature → Benefit → Proof
```

### Messaging by Audience

| Audience | They Care About | Messaging Emphasis |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| End user | Day-to-day workflow improvement | Ease of use, time savings |
| Manager | Team productivity, oversight | Collaboration, reporting |
| Executive | Business outcomes, ROI | Revenue impact, cost reduction |
| Technical | Implementation, security | Architecture, APIs, compliance |
| Procurement | Risk, compliance, cost | Security, SLA, pricing model |

## Competitive Intelligence

### Battlecard Template

Create for each key competitor:

```markdown
# Battlecard: {Your Product} vs {Competitor}

## Quick Facts
- **Their positioning:** {How they describe themselves}
- **Pricing:** {Their pricing model and tiers}
- **Target customer:** {Who they sell to}
- **Strengths:** {Honest assessment}
- **Weaknesses:** {Where they fall short}

## Where We Win
| Scenario | Why We Win | Talk Track |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| {Use case} | {Our advantage} | "{What to say to the prospect}" |

## Where They Win
| Scenario | Why They Win | Counter |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| {Use case} | {Their advantage} | "{How to reframe}" |

## Common Objections
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "They're cheaper" | "{Value-based response}" |
| "They have {feature}" | "{Reframe or roadmap response}" |
| "They're the market leader" | "{Category leadership angle}" |

## Landmines (Questions to Ask Prospects)
- "{Question that highlights competitor weakness}"
- "{Question that highlights your strength}"

## Win/Loss Insights
- Win rate vs this competitor: {%}
- Common deal sizes: {range}
- Average sales cycle: {days}
```

### Win/Loss Analysis Template

After each deal (won or lost), document:

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Outcome | Won / Lost |
| Competitor(s) | {Who you competed against} |
| Deal size | {Amount} |
| Decision maker | {Title/role} |
| Why they chose us / them | {Top 3 reasons} |
| What could have changed the outcome | {Specific actions} |
| Sales cycle length | {Days} |

## Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy

### Launch Tiers

| Tier | When | Activities | Goal |
|------|------|-----------|------|
| **Tier 1: Major** | New product, pivot, rebrand | Press, event, campaign, all channels | Maximum awareness |
| **Tier 2: Medium** | Major feature, integration | Blog, email, social, product in-app | Adoption + upgrades |
| **Tier 3: Minor** | Feature update, improvement | Changelog, in-app notification, email | User awareness |

## Important Notes

- Positioning is not tagline writing. It's a strategic decision about how to frame your product in the market.
- Talk to customers before finalizing positioning. Internal assumptions are often wrong.
- Refresh battlecards quarterly. Competitors change fast.
- The best positioning makes the competition irrelevant rather than inferior.
- Don't try to be everything to everyone. Strong positioning means saying no to some audiences.
